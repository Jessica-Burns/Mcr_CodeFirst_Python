# How do I get the API (web) app in my local computer?

You should now have a copy of this course repository in your
local computer. The most important thing is to make sure your
local copy is up to date with our version (your Python instructors).

If you are using GitKraken:
1. Open GitKraken and make sure you are on the master branch of the 'Shef_CodeFirst_Python'(remember this is displayed on the top left corner of the app).
2. Click on the pull icon and you should then see the usual blue pop over saying your version is up to date.
3. You are ready to go!

If you're using the command line:
1. Navigate to your local copy of the repository
2. Make sure your local copy is up to date by typing `git pull`
3. That's it!

Once you have updated your local repository you should be able to see a `session5` directory
